# Quark Languages
Welcome! This is the place to contribute to adding and editing languages for Quark! By contributing, you help us and the community as well as making Quark more accessible to more people. We are very grateful for the positive impact you will have upon others.

When contributing, you should:

- Ensure the translation is **accurate**
- Ensure the translation **makes sense**
- Stick to the format
- Don't translate the stuff within curly brackets - `{` `}` - just place it where it will fit best within the sentence
- Want to add a new language which doesn't exist here already? Head over to Quark's [support server](https://quark.bot/support) and ask ahead!
- There is also a [contribution guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) you can refer to!

Good luck, and have fun!
